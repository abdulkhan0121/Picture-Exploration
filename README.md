# Picture-Exploration

In this lab you will be writing methods that modify digital pictures. In writing these methods you will
learn how to traverse a two-dimensional array of integers or objects. You will also be introduced to
nested loops, binary numbers, interfaces, and inheritance.

Activities
You will be working through a set of activities. These activities will help you learn about how:
• digital pictures are represented on a computer;
• the binary number system is used to represent values;
• to create colors using light;
• Java handles two-dimensional arrays;
• data from a picture is stored; and
• to modify a digital picture.
